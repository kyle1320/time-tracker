A web app for tracking time spent on various tasks.

Built with React.

Designed to solve the issue of inaccurately logged time in the workplace, by making it easy to accurately track time split between several tasks.

The app is designed to be used in a narrow window, so that it can be split-screened along with another application (for example, I like to have one monitor shared between this application and Slack).
