# Time Tracker

A web app for tracking time spent on various tasks.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6d1e6dae-a34d-493e-8003-bd59736bc600/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kc-time-tracker/deploys)

Built with React, using the excellent [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Designed to solve the issue of inaccurately logged time in the workplace, by making it easy to accurately track time split between several tasks.

The app is designed to be used in a narrow window, so that it can be split-screened along with another application (for example, I like to have one monitor shared between this application and Slack).

## Get Started

You can try it out here:

This will open the app in your browser. You can even make changes to the code and watch it update instantly!
